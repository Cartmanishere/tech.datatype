  ;;It is important that raw copy can work with a lazy sequence of double buffers where
  ;;the same buffer is being filled for ever member of the lazy sequence.  This is an easy
  ;;optimization to make that cuts down the memory usage when reading from datasets by
  ;;a fairly large amount.

        ;;where we don't want to allocate dynamically an entire batch worth of data
        ;;every time but copy one image at a time into the packed buffer for upload
        ;;to the gpu.
