`tech.datatype` is for efficient manipulation of containers of data.

A nice (slightly out of date) post explaining more is [here](http://techascent.com/blog/datatype-library.html).

Generalized efficient manipulations of sequences of primitive datatype.
Includes specializations for java arrays, array views (subsection of an array)
and nio buffers.  There are specializations to allow implementations to provide
efficient full typed copy functions when the types can be ascertained.

  Generic operations include:
  1. datatype of this sequence
  2. Writing to, reading from
  3. Construction
  4. Efficient mutable copy into a container.
  5. Sparse buffer support
  6. n-dimensional tensor support
  7. Functional math support


For a quick feel if the library, please check out our [cheatsheet](docs/cheatsheet.md).


Design documenation is [here](docs).
